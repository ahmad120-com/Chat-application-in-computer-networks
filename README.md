# TCP/UDP-Based GUI Group Chat Application in Java
 This project implements a real-time GUI-based group chat application using Java. It combines the reliability of TCP for secure login with the speed of UDP for real-time group messaging. The system supports multiple clients, uses multithreading for concurrency, and demonstrates client-server communication using Java sockets.
